# **Project Title : Market Segmentation in Insurance**

### Problem Statement:

The objective of this project is to develop a customer segmentation strategy for a financial institution to better target their products and services. Market segmentation involves dividing the customer base into distinct groups based on shared characteristics such as demographics, purchasing behavior, and financial needs. By identifying these segments, the financial institution can tailor its offerings to meet the specific needs and preferences of each group, thereby improving customer satisfaction and maximizing business outcomes.

Specifically, the project aims to:

1. Analyze the customer dataset to identify key features and characteristics.
2. Apply clustering techniques to segment the customer base into meaningful groups.
3. Evaluate the quality of the clusters using appropriate evaluation metrics such as silhouette score, Davies–Bouldin index, or Calinski-Harabasz index.
4. Interpret the resulting segments and provide actionable recommendations for targeted marketing strategies and product offerings tailored to each segment.
5. Implement the segmentation strategy to enhance customer engagement, increase sales, and drive business growth.

By successfully implementing a customer segmentation strategy, the financial institution can effectively allocate resources, improve customer satisfaction, and achieve competitive advantage in the market.

Summary:

The project aimed to develop a customer segmentation strategy for a financial institution to better target its products and services. Market segmentation is crucial in understanding customer behavior and preferences, allowing businesses to tailor their offerings to meet specific customer needs. The dataset provided detailed behavioral variables for approximately 9000 active credit cardholders over the last 6 months.

Key Steps:

1. Data Analysis: The project began with an analysis of the dataset to identify key features and characteristics of the customers. Features such as balance, purchases, cash advance, credit limit, and payment behavior were examined to understand customer behavior.

2. Clustering Techniques: Various clustering techniques, including K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering, were applied to segment the customer base into meaningful groups. K-means clustering was used to partition the data into distinct clusters based on similarity, while hierarchical clustering created a tree-like structure of clusters.

3. Evaluation Metrics: Evaluation metrics such as silhouette score, Davies–Bouldin index, and Calinski-Harabasz index were utilized to assess the quality of the clusters. These metrics provided insights into the compactness and separation of the clusters, helping to determine the effectiveness of the segmentation strategy.

4. Interpretation and Recommendations: The resulting clusters were interpreted to identify common characteristics and behaviors within each segment. Actionable recommendations, such as targeted marketing strategies and product offerings tailored to each segment, were provided to improve customer engagement and drive business growth.

Conclusion:

Overall, the project successfully developed a customer segmentation strategy to enhance targeting and personalization in the financial institution's marketing efforts. By understanding the distinct needs and preferences of different customer segments, the institution can optimize resource allocation, improve customer satisfaction, and achieve competitive advantage in the market. Moving forward, continuous monitoring and refinement of the segmentation strategy will be essential to adapt to changing customer trends and market dynamics, ensuring sustained business success.
